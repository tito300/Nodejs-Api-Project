** 1 ** building structure of file
** 2 ** create express app in app.js and export it to use
        in www server file. then using mongoose to connect
        to db. then using app.listen to start app at port 3000
** 3 ** Mongoose findById and findOne using objectId is not working
        making me settle for findOne using 'name' for the moment.
** 4 ** used forEach() in mongodb shell to convert name to lowercase

** 5 ** Tried to add a logger like winston but failed. used morgan
        instead
** 6 ** added product route testing
**7** could not figure out how to close server after test
